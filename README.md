## My website is designed to provide users with the ability to search a keyword and browse a page of gif results.

![Index-Searched](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086984f0-226c-4cd2-be90-6c74c9ff5cbe)

## Once searched, they can click the "CLEAR" button to refresh the page and start over.

## Technologies include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, GiphyAPI, and Git/GitHub. 

## User stories:
 - As a visitor, I want to be welcomed by a simple but useful homepage with a search bar. 

 - As a visitor, I want to be able to enter keywords into the search bar to prompt images for browsing.

 - As a visitor, I want to be able to clear the page to easily enter additional search prompts.
